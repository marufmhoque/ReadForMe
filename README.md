<p>This application is an AI-powered document intelligence dashboard designed to help users organize and query local PDF files through a centralized interface. It leverages Google Gemini as its core reasoning engine to perform automated document profiling, where it "reads" each file to extract structured insights such as titles, document categories, sentiment analysis, summaries, and specific action items. Beyond static summaries, the app uses Gemini to power a contextual chat interface, allowing users to ask natural language questions and receive grounded answers based specifically on the content of their uploaded document library.</p>
